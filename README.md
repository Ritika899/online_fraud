# online_fraud
The advent of online payment systems has greatly simplified the payment process, making transactions more convenient and accessible. However, this ease of use has also led to a rise in payment fraud, particularly when it comes to credit card transactions. Online payment fraud can affect anyone using these systems, and the risk is heightened when credit cards are involved. This makes it crucial for credit card companies to implement robust fraud detection systems. By doing so, they can protect their customers from being charged for goods and services they never purchased, ensuring a secure and trustworthy payment environment.
### online payment fraud using machine learning-
To identify online payment fraud using machine learning, the first step is to train a model capable of classifying transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. To achieve this, we require a dataset that provides insights into online payment fraud. Such a dataset enables us to analyze transaction patterns and understand which characteristics are associated with fraudulent activity.

For this task, Iâ€™ve gathered a dataset from Kaggle that contains historical data on fraudulent transactions. This dataset is specifically designed to help detect fraud in online payments. Here are the columns included in the dataset:

step: Represents a time unit, where each step corresponds to one hour.

type: Indicates the type of online transaction.

amount: Specifies the amount involved in the transaction.

nameOrig: Identifies the customer initiating the transaction.

oldbalanceOrg: The balance of the originating customer before the transaction.

newbalanceOrig: The balance of the originating customer after the transaction.

nameDest: Identifies the recipient of the transaction.

oldbalanceDest: The recipient's balance before the transaction.

newbalanceDest: The recipient's balance after the transaction.

isFraud: A label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

By analyzing these features, we can develop a model to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions in online payment systems.
